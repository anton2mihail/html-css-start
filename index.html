    <p>Created by Netscape in 1995 as an extension of HTML for Netscape Navigator 2.0, JavaScript had as its main function the
        manipulation of HTML documents and form validation. Before winning this name so famous nowadays, JavaScript was called
        Mocha.</p>
    <p> When it first shipped in beta releases, it was officially called LiveScript and finally, when it was released by Sun
        Microsystems, was baptized with the name by which it is known today. Because of the similar names, people confuse
        JavaScript with Java.
    </p>
    <p>Although both have the lexical structure of programming, they are not the same language. Different from C, C# and Java,
        JavaScript is an interpreted language. It means that it needs an "interpreter". In case of JavaScript, the interpreter
        is the browser.</p>
